# Change the character set{#change-the-character-set}

You can specify the character set used to encode the output stream.

1. In administration console, click Services &gt; output.
1. Under Internationalization, in the Character Set list, select a character set. This setting is dependent on the `TransformationFormat` and `PrintFormat` specified through the API. To specify a character set other than those listed, select Custom and specify an encoding value in the box that is displayed.

   If `TransformationFormat` is PDF and PDF/A or `PrintFormat` is PCL, PostScript, Zebra label, IPL, DPL, TPCL, GenericColorPCL, or GenericPSLevel3, only specific character sets are supported.

   The character set must be a valid canonical name. The default value is ISO-8859-1.

1. Click Save.
